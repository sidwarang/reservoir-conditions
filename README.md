# Reservoir Conditions

This is a nodejs application which reads reservoir level data from a JSON file and displays it on a map.

The map is created using Google Maps API and the data is displayed in the form of charts (D3JS, Highcharts).

Custom markers on the map mark the location for which the data is displayed.

## Installation

Download the code, navigate to the root directory of the project from the terminal and run the following command:
```sh
npm install && npm start
```
Now open
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
in the browser.
